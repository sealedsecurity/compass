// who it is, where it runs, and which model to use. Everything here is read by
// the agent at boot (packages/compass-agent/src/cli.ts) or enforced by podman at
// exec time, so a dropped or misspelled key is a silently broken session rather
// than a build error. Each test names the contract a plausible bug would break.
//
// The argv these specs assemble into is not re-tested here — execStreamingArgs
// is covered in internal/runtime/podman_test.go. This file pins the spec.
