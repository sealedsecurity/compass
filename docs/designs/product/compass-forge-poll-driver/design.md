# Compass forge-poll driver (SEA-1810)

Status: Active
Lane: compass-server
Tracker: SEA

OQ-A is RESOLVED — Matt ruled **Option 2** (2026-08-07): this driver is built
ON the DL-053 forge-subscription machinery from day one, with the board as a
distinguished subscriber. OQ-C and OQ-D are RESOLVED (Matt, 2026-08-08): the
board's poll targets are TABLE rows — a new `forge_repo_subscriptions` table,
dynamically add/removable, with DL-053's spec'd `forge_subscriptions` landing
RENAMED `agent_forge_subscriptions` — all four forge tables land
unconditionally in migration 0015, and every provider CHECK admits the full
declared enum `IN (1, 2, 3, 4)` (see Open Questions). Freeze now waits only
on the human design review + the review-agent pass. This record designs the
running driver that periodically drives the existing greenfield
`go/internal/ingest` library against a real GitHub forge, so board issues
ingested from the tracker appear live in the Compass server projection — and
it instantiates the DL-053 fetch-cursor model (migration + store + poll
driver) as it does so. Design layer only — no implementation code ships with
this record.

## Problem / Intent

Board issues ingested from the external tracker (GitHub) must appear live in
the Compass server projection. Today nothing drives ingestion: `server/serve.go`
wires no poller and imports neither `internal/ingest` nor `internal/forge`
(verified this run — the only mentions of a poller in `go/server` are forward
references, e.g. `server/board.go:40` "the PR-B poll driver … add producers
without changing the executor signature", and the pgtest comment
`server/service_board_pgtest_test.go:14` "exactly as part 3's poller would").
The `internal/ingest` library (`ingest.go:35-65`) is complete and tested but is
exercised only by its own tests and the board pgtest suite.

This slice adds the running driver as **the first DL-053 forge subscriber**:
the DL-053 conditional-poll loop (durable Postgres FETCH cursor → conditional
GET → sink → advance), started at serve boot under the serve errgroup, with
the board as its distinguished, always-on local subscriber and the first real
(non-fake) forge read client behind it. The DL-053 forge-subscription tables
do not exist yet (migrations in `go/internal/store/migrations/` stop at
`0014_channel_policy.sql`; a repo-wide search for `forge_subscriptions` /
`forge_artifact_cursors` under `go/` returns nothing — the existing
`0006_delivery_cursors.sql` table is `agent_delivery_cursors`, the comms
agent-notification fan-out, "how far an agent has confirmed delivery on a
channel", a different subsystem entirely). This slice therefore builds the
fetch half of that machinery: the four-table migration (including the
board's own target table, `forge_repo_subscriptions`), the target + cursor
store layer, and the poll driver that PR-C (tracker-status ingestion,
DL-129) and the later agent-notification slice both ride — one fetch path,
no convergence refactor ever needed.

## Global Constraints

- **Toolchain:** module `github.com/sealedsecurity/compass/go`, go 1.25.0
  (`go/go.mod`).
- **DL-053 (FROZEN, Matt 2026-07-27, `DECISIONS.md:76`) — the target model,
  not an option:** "Forge subscriptions are Server-side Postgres rows with a
  per-artifact FETCH cursor (advanced on any 200) split from a per-subscriber
  DELIVERY cursor (advanced only on that subscriber's own successful notify),
  change-detected by conditional polling in v1 (webhooks are an additive
  accelerator), delivered by account on the existing `Sessions` →
  `AgentGateway.Control` push path." Full text + DDL:
  `compass-server-ownership-layer/design.md:942-1019` (Decision 5). This
  record consumes that model — it never amends it. The two genuine forks in
  applying it to a repo-LIST board subscriber are RESOLVED (Matt,
  2026-08-08): the board's subscription set is a TABLE — the new
  `forge_repo_subscriptions` (OQ-C) — and the spec'd tables land NOW with
  the full provider domain (OQ-D). What was never a fork: the repo-LIST
  fetch-cursor CLASS (`forge_list_cursors`, Approach (a)) is author-adopted
  as the only coherent shape for a LIST-granularity ETag, and the coordinate
  alignment to the tree's 0013 convention (SMALLINT provider + `forge_host`)
  is the mechanical application of an existing standard. The two spec'd
  tables are labeled `0004_forge` in that (older) record; the tree's
  migrations reach `0014`, so they land here as part of
  `0015_forge_subscriptions.sql`.
- **The DL-053 `forge_subscriptions` table lands RENAMED
  `agent_forge_subscriptions` (Matt's explicit option under OQ-C):** shape
  and columns unchanged from the spec'd DDL
  (`compass-server-ownership-layer/design.md:978-999`) — a NAMING
  clarification, not a shape amendment — disambiguating the two subscription
  concepts: `agent_forge_subscriptions` is the per-ARTIFACT, agent-owned
  subscription (`agent_account_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES agent_accounts`,
  `:980`); `forge_repo_subscriptions` is the board's per-REPO poll target
  (new, this record). A future reader maps `agent_forge_subscriptions` back
  to DL-053's `forge_subscriptions`. The rename is recorded in the ledger as
  DL-163 (rides THIS PR); the paired one-line forward annotation at the frozen
  ownership-layer DDL is deferred to SEA-1883 (editing a frozen record needs
  Matt's call — see Open Questions → OQ-C).
- **Provider domain `IN (1, 2, 3, 4)` on every 0015 table (OQ-D2, Matt
  2026-08-08):** the proto enum already declares all four providers —
  `FORGE_PROVIDER_GITHUB = 1 … FORGE_PROVIDER_LINEAR = 4`
  (`proto/compass/v1/compass.proto:699-706`;
  `gen/compass/v1/compass.pb.go:448-453`). The CHECK's job is "never
  UNSPECIFIED(0)", NOT gating rollout — rollout is gated by which
  `forge.Provider` has a real client (GitHub only, this slice). The
  pre-existing `issues` CHECK `IN (1, 2, 3)` (`0013_issues.sql:32`) excludes
  Linear and is a SEPARATE prerequisite for actually ingesting Linear
  issues — out of scope here, documented as OQ-E.
- **DL-129 (FROZEN, Matt 2026-08-04, `DECISIONS.md:176`):** tracker native
  status "is ingested into the DL-070 server projection through the reverse
  `TrackerStatusMapping` (DL-053 poll; echo-suppressed in tracker-status
  space, tracker-sourced transitions never mirror back, stale polls dropped
  by a recency guard)". That names THIS driver as the poll PR-C rides:
  tracker status is a field on the same `/issues` rows this loop fetches
  (`forge.Issue.State`, `provider.go:45-46` — "the forge's truth
  (\"open\" | \"closed\")"), so PR-C MUST NOT re-fetch the endpoint (see
  Approach → the one-fetch-path guarantee).
- **OQ-6 (FROZEN, Matt 2026-07-27):** the GitHub client is hand-rolled over
  `net/http`, **no new dependency** (~300 LOC); go-github is REJECTED — it
  lacks a conditional-request + budget mechanism hook. Conditional requests
  (`If-None-Match`/ETag → treat `304 Not Modified` as no-change) and honoring
  `x-ratelimit-*` response headers as a budget are **mandatory**, not
  optional hardening.
- **DL-052 (Active, `DECISIONS.md:75`):** only the Server holds forge
  credentials, as a `server_only` declared secret filtered out of container
  injection. The driver reads its GitHub token via the Server's secret path
  (the `secrets.SpecResolver` instance built at `server/serve.go:287`) —
  never from an agent/container, never from a flag that would land in `ps`
  output.
- **Error mapping:** every non-2xx forge response maps to
  `*forge.StatusError{Status, Message}` (`forge/provider.go:216-227`), so the
  Service layer can flatten statuses without inspecting the wire.
- **Idempotency (load-bearing, now expressed over the DURABLE cursor):** a
  failed or partial poll is safe to retry — "partial progress is fine — a
  re-poll is idempotent on the coordinate" (`ingest.go:48-52`; the coordinate
  is the store upsert key, `store/migrations/0013_issues.sql:57-59`). The
  invariant the durable FETCH cursor must preserve: **a stored list-page ETag
  attests that every row of that page's content was durably sunk when the
  ETag was stored.** Concretely: the driver advances a page's cursor row ONLY
  AFTER every issue on that page has sunk through
  `IssueProjection.PublishIssueUpdate` (a durable upsert,
  `issue_projection.go:68-74`). A mid-page sink failure leaves the old ETag in
  place, so the next tick's conditional GET carries the OLD ETag, the changed
  content returns `200`, and the page re-sinks — no issue is ever stranded
  behind an advanced cursor. This is the same invariant DL-053's
  "advances unconditionally on any 200" expresses for per-artifact rows,
  where the fetched state persists as `snapshot` **in the same row as the
  ETag** (`compass-server-ownership-layer/design.md:1016`): never advance a
  fetch cursor past state you have not durably captured. Here the durable
  capture is the projection upsert itself, so the advance follows the sink;
  the advance is still NEVER conditioned on any subscriber's wire delivery
  (the board has none — see Approach), which is the coupling DL-053 forbids.
- **No projection change:** `board.IssueProjection.PublishIssueUpdate(ctx,
  *compassv1.Issue) error` (`board/issue_projection.go:68`) ALREADY satisfies
  `ingest.issueSink` (`ingest.go:31-33`). This slice adds zero code to
  `internal/board`.
- **`ingest` imports no store:** the package doc holds that "it imports NO
  store. The proto->store mapping edge is part 4 (the sink's real
  implementation)" (`ingest.go:7-8`). The driver's durable-cursor dependency
  therefore enters `ingest` as a package-local structural interface
  (`PollStore`, T3), with the `*store.Store` adapter living in `server/`
  (T4) — the same narrow-seam pattern as `forgeReader`/`issueSink`
  (`ingest.go:20-33`).
- **Non-goals:** the tracker-status ingestion itself (PR-C — the reverse
  `TrackerStatusMapping`, echo-suppression, recency guard; a separate slice
  that consumes the seam this record makes explicit); the tracker-status
  WRITE-back / outbound mirror (T3-b); the agent-notification DELIVERY half
  of DL-053 (per-agent `agent_forge_subscriptions` rows, `DetectChanges`,
  per-artifact comment/check ETags, the `Sessions` → `AgentGateway.Control`
  push) — that slice adds subscribers and wire delivery ON the tables and
  driver built here, it does not rebuild the fetch path; and the dynamic
  add/remove MUTATION surface (RPC or admin UI) for
  `forge_repo_subscriptions` — this slice builds the table + the T4 boot
  seed reconcile as its only writer; the mutation surface rides a later
  slice. This record is the BOARD-ingestion read poll plus the DL-053 fetch
  machinery it stands on.

## Approach

Four pieces, one per task: a concrete GitHub read client in `internal/forge`
(T1, carried over from the pre-ruling cut nearly intact), the DL-053 cursor
migration + store layer (T2), the conditional-poll driver in `internal/ingest`
(T3), and boot wiring + config surface in `server/serve.go` +
`cmd/compass-server/main.go` (T4).

### The impedance Option 2 must design around: per-artifact vs repo-LIST

DL-053's subscription model is **per-artifact**: "An agent subscribes to a
*forge artifact*: an issue or a PR, named by `(provider, repo, kind, number)`"
(`compass-server-ownership-layer/design.md:944-945`), and the FETCH cursor
table is keyed the same way (`:1007-1019`, `PRIMARY KEY (provider, repo, kind,
number)`). SEA-1810's board ingestion is **per-repo LIST**: fetch every issue
in a repo in one paginated `/issues?state=all` walk (`Ingester.Ingest`
"fetches every issue for repo", `ingest.go:48`) and sink each. A list-page
ETag is a caching fact about a URL (repo + filter + page), not about any one
artifact — it cannot be stored per-artifact without inventing data. Three
framings were weighed:

- **(a) The board is a distinguished repo-scoped subscriber — ADOPTED for the
  fetch cursor.** The repo LIST is its own fetch-cursor class: a new
  `forge_list_cursors` table keyed `(provider, host, repo, page)` holding the
  per-page ETag + Link-chain fact (`has_next`), sibling to (not a widening of)
  the DL-053 per-artifact `forge_artifact_cursors`. It is the same
  fetch-cursor IDEA — a durable conditional-GET cache, advanced with the
  durably captured state, shared by every consumer of the fetch — applied at
  the LIST granularity. The board's DELIVERY cursor is degenerate: the board
  is one always-on, in-process consumer whose "notify" is the synchronous
  projection sink inside the poll pass, so sunk-ness is already encoded by
  the page-cursor advance (Global Constraints → Idempotency) and no
  `delivered_revision` row is needed — exactly the per-subscriber cursor
  DL-053 splits out for subscribers whose notify can fail independently of
  the fetch, which the board's cannot (OQ-C resolved this reading: the board
  holds no delivery cursor and no per-artifact subscription row; its
  repo-level poll targets are `forge_repo_subscriptions` rows — the table
  model, Approach → the four forge tables).
- **(b) The board subscribes to each issue individually, seeded by a repo
  enumeration — REJECTED.** N per-artifact `agent_forge_subscriptions` rows
  per repo, and the enumeration that seeds them IS a repo LIST fetch — so the
  LIST (and its paging/ETag problem) remains, plus a per-issue row-churn loop
  on top. It removes nothing and adds a reconcile.
- **(c) The LIST fetch feeds per-artifact state as it enumerates — ADOPTED as
  the sharing seam.** Every `/issues` LIST row carries the full issue payload
  including its forge state (`forge.Issue.State`, `provider.go:45-46`), so
  the one LIST fetch can feed N consumers: the board sink today; PR-C's
  reverse-status mapping tomorrow (same pass, second sink — it consumes the
  rows this fetch already returns, never a second request, though it reads
  fields beyond `State`: DL-129's recency guard needs the row's `updated_at`,
  which T1 therefore parses into `forge.Issue` from day one, see the
  one-fetch-path guarantee); and, when the agent-notification slice lands,
  LIST-fed upserts of `forge_artifact_cursors.revision`/`snapshot`/`polled_at`
  for subscribed issues (their per-issue `etag` column stays `''` — it belongs
  to the single-issue endpoint the LIST never hits; comments/checks ETags
  likewise arrive only with that slice's own endpoints). The driver exposes
  this as a seam (T3: the per-pass raw-issue batch flows through one
  `Ingester.IngestIssues` call a second sink can be composed onto), and this
  record keeps every downstream writer OUT of its build.

**The one-fetch-path guarantee (the property Matt's ruling bought), stated
explicitly:** PR-C never issues a request against `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues`.
The endpoint has exactly one caller — this driver's T1 client — and exactly one
cursor state — `forge_list_cursors`. PR-C lands as an additional consumer of
the same pass (the reverse `TrackerStatusMapping` applied to the same
`[]forge.Issue` batch the board sink receives), so DL-129's "DL-053 poll" IS
this driver, the shared rate budget is spent once, and no convergence refactor
is ever needed. What PR-C adds on the fetch side: no request, no endpoint, no
cursor state — only, at most, additional fields parsed off rows this fetch
already returns (the `updated_at` its recency guard needs is parsed here in
T1; `state_reason` similarly, if the reopen mapping wants it). "One fetch
path" is exact; "adds literally nothing" would not be, so the claim is stated
as the former.

### The four forge tables (`0015_forge_subscriptions.sql`)

Migration 0015 lands FOUR tables unconditionally (OQ-D1, RESOLVED land-now,
Matt 2026-08-08): the board's repo-level target set
(`forge_repo_subscriptions`, new — OQ-C's table model), the repo-LIST fetch
cursor (`forge_list_cursors`), and the two DL-053-spec'd tables
(`agent_forge_subscriptions` — DL-053's `forge_subscriptions`, renamed — and
`forge_artifact_cursors`), the latter two adapted from the ownership-layer
DDL (`compass-server-ownership-layer/design.md:976-1019`, there labeled
"`0004_forge`"; the label predates the current migration count, so it lands
as `0015`). The division of labor:

- **`forge_repo_subscriptions`** — the board's per-REPO poll targets,
  dynamically add/removable: an operator adds a repo → a row; removes → the
  row is deleted (or `enabled` flipped false — soft-disable that keeps
  cursor history), and its `forge_list_cursors` rows go inert. This REPLACES
  the pre-ruling config-declared `ForgeConfig.Repos`-IS-the-subscription-set
  model throughout this record: the driver enumerates `WHERE enabled` at the
  top of every pass (T3), and the `--forge-repos` flag becomes a declarative
  SEED reconciled into the table at boot (T4). Keyed by the forge coordinate
  MINUS artifact: `(forge_provider, forge_host, repo)`.
- **`forge_list_cursors`** — the per-page fetch cursor of a target repo's
  LIST walk (DDL below; the driver's own working table).
- **`agent_forge_subscriptions` + `forge_artifact_cursors`** — the DL-053
  per-artifact agent-notification machinery, writer-less this slice: nothing
  this slice EXECUTES touches them; they land as anticipatory schema, shape
  frozen + pgtest-covered (T2 test 7) before their writers (PR-C / the
  agent-notification slice) exist.

Adaptations, now all settled (the two that were OQ-D's sub-forks are ruled;
the rest are the mechanical application of existing tree standards):

- **Coordinate alignment (author-decided):** the spec'd DDL keys on
  `provider TEXT` and omits the forge host; the tree's frozen issue
  coordinate is `(forge_provider SMALLINT, forge_host, repo, number)`
  (`0013_issues.sql:29-35` — "forge coordinate: the idempotency key"). Every
  0015 key adopts the 0013 convention (SMALLINT provider enum + `forge_host
  TEXT NOT NULL`) so cursor and subscription rows join the `issues`
  coordinate without casts and GHES hosts never collide on `repo` alone.
- **Provider domain (OQ-D2, RESOLVED, Matt 2026-08-08):** every provider
  CHECK in 0015 admits the FULL declared proto enum — `CHECK (forge_provider
  IN (1, 2, 3, 4))`, GitHub/GitLab/Forgejo/Linear
  (`proto/compass/v1/compass.proto:699-706`). The CHECK's job is "never
  UNSPECIFIED(0)", NOT gating rollout: rollout is gated by which
  `forge.Provider` has a real client (GitHub only, this slice; Matt: "we
  need linear for dogfood, linear and github. gitlab/forgejo can come later
  in beta etc."). Admitting the whole declared domain — never a
  non-contiguous subset — means the future Linear-ingestion slice needs no
  CHECK-widening migration on any 0015 table. (An earlier draft of this
  record recommended narrowing to `IN (1, 2, 3)` to match 0013; that was
  WRONG — it dropped Linear, which dogfood needs, and mistook the CHECK for
  a rollout gate. The 0013 `issues` CHECK itself is the separate OQ-E
  prerequisite.)
- **The rename (OQ-C):** `forge_subscriptions` → `agent_forge_subscriptions`
  (Global Constraints; columns unchanged from
  `compass-server-ownership-layer/design.md:978-999`).

The three tables beyond the driver's own working table:

```sql
-- The board's repo-level poll targets (OQ-C, the table model): one row per
-- (provider, host, repo) the poll driver walks. enabled=FALSE soft-disables
-- a target without deleting its cursor history. Populated in v1 by the T4
-- boot seed reconcile (--forge-repos, bootstrap-only insert: ON CONFLICT DO
-- NOTHING — the table is authoritative after the first insert); a mutation
-- RPC/admin surface is a named non-goal of this slice. For GITHUB the repo
-- string is lowercased at the seed/upsert boundary (GitHub owner/name is
-- case-insensitive-but-case-preserving, so Owner/Name and owner/name must
-- NOT mint two PK rows -> two poll targets -> two issues rows under the
-- 0013 coordinate). updated_at is touched on every upsert/enable-flip,
-- giving an operator a timestamp to correlate a state change against
-- (the audit posture of advanced_at on forge_list_cursors).
CREATE TABLE forge_repo_subscriptions (
    forge_provider SMALLINT NOT NULL CHECK (forge_provider IN (1, 2, 3, 4)),
    forge_host     TEXT     NOT NULL,

-- Writer-less this slice — PR-C / the agent-notification slice bring its

-- concern, deferred with the writers.
CREATE TABLE forge_artifact_cursors (

    forge_host     TEXT NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY (forge_provider, forge_host, repo, kind, number)

```

The driver's own working table:

```sql
-- FETCH cursor for a repo-level issue LIST walk: one row per (coordinate,
-- page). The repo-LIST analogue of forge_artifact_cursors — a durable
-- conditional-GET cache, one writer (the poll driver), N read-side consumers.
-- etag advances ONLY after every row of that page's content is durably sunk
-- (the projection upsert is the snapshot store — see the record's Idempotency
-- constraint). has_next persists the Link-chain fact so a 304 (which need not
-- re-send Link) can keep walking a multi-page repo. NOTE the one gap of the
-- stored-Link walk: content that enters the repo sorted BEYOND the last stored
-- page (an issue transferred/imported with an old created_at, under GitHub's
-- default created-desc order) perturbs no stored page — every page 304s and
-- the last row's has_next=false stops the walk, so the new content is missed
-- until unrelated page-1 activity forces a 200. The driver closes this with a
-- bounded unconditional probe of last_page+1 every Nth all-304 walk (see the
-- poll driver) — no schema change. advanced_at records the last content
-- advance (an etag-storing 200+sink), NOT the last poll: an all-304 tick reads
-- the page but rewrites no row, so the column deliberately names "last change".
CREATE TABLE forge_list_cursors (
    forge_provider SMALLINT NOT NULL CHECK (forge_provider IN (1, 2, 3, 4)),
    forge_host     TEXT     NOT NULL,
    repo           TEXT     NOT NULL,
    page           INTEGER  NOT NULL CHECK (page >= 1),
    etag           TEXT     NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    has_next       BOOLEAN  NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    advanced_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    PRIMARY KEY (forge_provider, forge_host, repo, page)
);
```

What the durable cursor buys over the pre-ruling in-memory ETag map: no full
`state=all` re-fetch storm on server restart (an unchanged repo is an all-304
pass from the first post-boot tick — the projection is already durable and
`Rehydrate`-seeded, `serve.go:259-263`, so a 304 page needs no re-sink);
a durable substrate a future multi-replica server COULD share (a precondition,
not a sufficiency — the projection sink assumes single-threaded ingestion per
coordinate, `issue_projection.go:62-67`, so multi-replica would still need
per-coordinate serialization / leader election this slice does not design);
and the "shared fetch primitive" PR-C rides is a real table, not an aspiration
inside one process's heap.

### The GitHub read client (`forge.GitHub`, new file `go/internal/forge/github.go`) — T1, survives the ruling

The pre-ruling T1 survives nearly intact — the client is the shared fetch half
either way. The ONE structural change the ruling forces: the client becomes
**stateless about cursors**. The pre-ruling cut kept a per-URL in-memory
ETag + parsed-response + Link-chain cache inside the client; under Option 2
the ETag lives in `forge_list_cursors` and the DRIVER owns it (it must — only
the driver can see the sink outcome the advance is gated on, which is exactly
why an in-client cursor was already flagged as structurally unable to be
correct: "the client's sole seam is `ListIssues([]Issue, error)`",
`provider.go:37-53` carries no timestamp and no sink signal). So the client
gains a page-level conditional-fetch primitive that takes the caller's ETag
and reports `NotModified` without caching anything, and the whole-walk
`ListIssues` remains as an unconditional convenience built on it (it is also
the read half of the eventual `forge.Provider`, `provider.go:195-207`; no
`var _ Provider` assertion — read half only).

A hand-rolled `net/http` client (OQ-6). Behavior, in order of the request
lifecycle:

1. **Auth.** Every request carries `Authorization: Bearer <token>` where the
   token comes from `TokenSource.Token(ctx)` — resolved per
   request batch, not captured at construction, so a rotated `server_only`
   secret takes effect without a restart (composes with DL-052; see T4 for the
   resolve wiring).
2. **Conditional requests (ETag/304) — the steady-state reducer.** The caller
   passes the page's stored ETag; the client sends `If-None-Match` and maps a
   `304 Not Modified` to `ListPage{NotModified: true}` — no body, no re-parse,
   nothing cached client-side. Per current GitHub docs a 304 is not charged
   against the core rate limit. **That fact is load-bearing for the budget
   math and MUST be reverified against current GitHub REST docs at T1** (the
   rate-limit docs have been revised before). On a no-change tick every page
   of a quiet repo costs zero rate budget and sinks nothing (the projection
   already holds the rows durably).
3. **Rate budget.** After every response the client records
   `x-ratelimit-remaining` and `x-ratelimit-reset`. Before issuing a request,
   if `remaining <= reserve` (default reserve 10), it fails fast with a typed
   budget error (`forge.ErrBudgetExhausted`, exact shape in T1 Interfaces)
   rather than burning the tail of the budget; the driver skips that cycle and
   retries next tick (safe: re-poll is idempotent, `ingest.go:51-52`). Budget
   exhaustion is an EXPECTED skip, not a failure — the driver detects
   `errors.Is(err, forge.ErrBudgetExhausted)` and logs it at `slog.Warn`, NOT
   the `slog.Error` path a real provider/sink error takes, so a rate-limited
   window is not per-tick Error noise. **403 disambiguation (a single rule —
   GitHub overloads 403 across rate-limit, bad-credentials, and
   repo-permission causes):** a `403`/`429` carrying `retry-after` OR a zeroed
   `x-ratelimit-remaining` → `forge.ErrBudgetExhausted` (Warn, budget-skip, NO
   token re-resolve); a `401`, or a `403` whose body `message` is a
   bad-credentials/permission error with NO rate-limit headers →
   `*forge.StatusError` AND, before returning, the client calls
   `Invalidate()` on its `TokenSource` (Interfaces below) so the NEXT batch
   re-resolves — the T4 TTL cache drops its value on `Invalidate`; the seam is
   the client's, since the client is the only component that observes the auth
   failure (the T4 secret-resolve bullet wires it); any other non-2xx →
   `*forge.StatusError` only
   (step 7). The discriminator is the presence of `retry-after` / a zeroed
   `x-ratelimit-remaining`, nothing else — so a dead token is never mistaken
   for a rate-limit skip (which would retry forever with the dead token,
   never re-resolving) and a rate-limit 403 never becomes per-tick Error spam.
   The client never sleeps holding the caller's poll slot — backoff is the
   driver's ticker, not an in-client `time.Sleep`. (Under sustained pressure a
   skipped tick can defer ingestion up to a full reset window (~60 min);
   acceptable given idempotency, and ETag/304 keeps steady-state spend near
   zero.)
4. **Pagination.** GitHub's list-issues endpoint pages; the client requests
   `per_page=100`. `ListIssuesPage` reports whether an RFC-5988 `Link:
   rel="next"` exists (`HasNext`) — the DRIVER walks pages so it can sink and
   advance the cursor per page; `ListIssues` follows the chain itself and
   concatenates (the `Ingester` contract is "fetches every issue for repo",
   `ingest.go:48`).
5. **Filter mapping.** `forge.IssueFilter{State, Labels}`
   (`provider.go:182-188`) maps to `state=`/`labels=` query params. An empty
   `State` — which is what the board path always sends — maps to
   **`state=all`**, this provider's documented default (`provider.go:183-184`
   delegates the empty case to "the provider's default"). Rationale: the
   board needs closed tracker issues to flow so their `ForgeState` stays fresh
   on the row; an open-only default would silently freeze closed issues at
   their last-seen forge state. (The reopen→un-archive LIFECYCLE transition
   rides tracker-STATUS ingestion — PR-C, DL-129 — not this slice, which
   writes `ForgeState` but never `State`; `state=all` here only keeps
   `ForgeState` current on closed rows. Under Option 2 PR-C applies that
   mapping to THIS driver's rows — the same `state=all` fetch is its input.)
6. **PR exclusion.** GitHub's issues API returns pull requests as issues
   (rows carrying a `pull_request` key); the client drops them — the board's
   PR surface is a separate lane, and `forge.Issue` (`provider.go:37-53`) is
   issue-shaped only.
7. **Error mapping.** Any non-2xx/non-304 response that step 3's 403
   disambiguation does NOT classify as a budget skip becomes
   `&forge.StatusError{Status: resp.StatusCode, Message: <GitHub message
   field>}` (`provider.go:216-227`), wrapped so `errors.As` finds it. Bodies
   are returned RAW — the owner-header strip belongs to ingestion
   (`provider.go:42-44`, `ingest.go:67-74`), never the provider.

### The conditional-poll driver (`ingest.Driver`, new file `go/internal/ingest/driver.go`) — the DL-053 poll

The DL-053 poll loop, specialized to its first artifact class (the repo LIST)
and its first subscriber (the board). It lives in the `ingest` package (it
composes the package's own `Ingester`; a new package would be a second
convention for no gain) and consumes the durable cursor through the
package-local `PollStore` structural interface (Global Constraints → ingest
imports no store).

- `Run(ctx)` performs one immediate pass at start (so a freshly booted demo
  server shows the board without waiting a full interval), then ticks on
  `time.Ticker(interval)`.
- Each pass first enumerates its targets — `PollStore.ListEnabledRepos`,
  the `forge_repo_subscriptions WHERE enabled` read (OQ-C's table model) —
  then iterates them sequentially: one forge, one budget; parallel per-repo
  fetches would just race the same rate limit. A row added between ticks is
  polled on the next pass; a disabled/deleted row simply stops being polled
  (its `forge_list_cursors` rows are inert and its issues remain in the
  projection). No restart either way.
- **Per-repo pass = the DL-053 read-modify-advance cycle, page-wise:**

  1. Read the repo's stored page cursors (`PollStore.ListCursor` → page →
     `{etag, hasNext}`).
  2. From page 1: `ListIssuesPage(ctx, repo, forge.IssueFilter{}, page,
     storedETag)`.
     - **304** → nothing changed on that page and its content is already
       durably sunk (the Idempotency invariant: a stored ETag attests the
       sink); continue to the next page if the STORED row says `has_next`
       (a 304 need not re-send `Link`, so the chain fact is read from the
       cursor row, not the response).
     - **200** → `Ingester.IngestIssues(ctx, repo, page.Issues)` (translate +
       sink each, stop at first sink error — the existing per-issue pipeline,
       `ingest.go:58-63`, factored to take a caller-fetched batch); ONLY on
       full-page sink success, `UpsertListCursorPage` with the new ETag +
       `HasNext`; continue while `HasNext`.
     - **Budget error** (`errors.Is(err, forge.ErrBudgetExhausted)`) → Warn,
       abandon this repo's pass; already-advanced pages stay advanced (their
       content is sunk — safe).
     - **Any other error** (provider or sink) → `slog.Error`, abandon this
       repo's pass WITHOUT advancing the failing page; next tick re-fetches
       it (the old ETag no longer matches the changed content → 200 →
       re-sink; idempotent on the coordinate).
  3. After a clean full walk, `PruneListCursorPages(repo, lastPage)` — a repo
     that shrank drops its stale tail rows.
  4. **Boundary probe (closes the stored-`has_next` gap, M1):** the stored-Link
     walk in step 2 stops at the last stored page, so content that enters
     sorted BEYOND that boundary without perturbing any stored page (a
     transfer/import with an old `created_at`, under GitHub's default
     `created`-desc order) is invisible to a pure 304 walk until unrelated
     page-1 activity forces a 200. To bound the staleness, when a walk served
     ALL 304s (no page advanced) the driver unconditionally fetches
     `lastPage+1` once every Nth such consecutive all-304 walk (default N = 60,
     ~hourly at the 1m interval; the counter is per-repo, reset by any 200).
     A never-stored page is already an `etag=''` unconditional GET, so the
     mechanism exists — a `HasNext`/non-empty result there resumes the normal
     walk and re-anchors the tail; an empty 200 costs one request per hour on a
     quiet repo. An empty probe page (`HasNext=false`, zero issues) writes NO
     cursor row — the per-page upsert is skipped when the page has zero issues,
     so the probe never persists an empty tail row that would then 304 forever
     and sit outside `PruneListCursorPages`' post-walk `page > lastPage` drop.
     This is a documented probe rule, not a fork.

- **A failed poll is logged, never fatal.** `Run` never returns a non-nil
  error — its sole exit is ctx cancellation, returning `nil` so the errgroup
  drain (see wiring) treats shutdown as clean.
- **Graceful shutdown:** `<-ctx.Done()` between passes and via the ctx
  threaded through fetch and sink mid-pass (both `ListIssuesPage` and
  `PublishIssueUpdate` take ctx).
- **The board's delivery half is degenerate, by design:** DL-053 splits the
  DELIVERY cursor per subscriber because "advancement conditional on a
  successful notify" over a shared cursor produces deterministic duplicates
  across subscribers with different liveness
  (`compass-server-ownership-layer/design.md:949-961`). The board is one
  in-process subscriber whose notify IS the synchronous sink inside the pass —
  there is no wire delivery to fail independently of the fetch, so its
  delivery state is fully encoded by the page-cursor advance and it holds no
  `agent_forge_subscriptions` row — its membership is repo-level, a
  `forge_repo_subscriptions` row (OQ-C, resolved). Wire subscribers (agents)
  arrive with the notification slice and bring their own `delivered_revision`
  rows, exactly per spec.
- **The PR-C seam (downstream consumer, OUT of this build):** the per-pass
  raw batch (`[]forge.Issue` per 200 page) flows through one
  `Ingester.IngestIssues` call. PR-C composes its reverse
  `TrackerStatusMapping` sink onto that same batch (and its per-artifact
  `forge_artifact_cursors.revision`/`snapshot`/`polled_at` upserts, LIST-fed —
  no per-issue GET), in its own slice. Nothing in this record's build writes
  `agent_forge_subscriptions` or `forge_artifact_cursors`.
- **Observability:** one `slog.Info` per completed repo pass with fields
  `repo`, `issues` (count sunk), `pages`, `not_modified` (bool: whole walk
  served 304s), `dur`, `ratelimit_remaining`; one `slog.Warn` per
  budget-skipped pass (an expected condition, never `Error`); one
  `slog.Error` only per genuinely failed pass (provider/sink error) with
  `repo`, `err`. Boot logs one `slog.Info` with `seed_repos` (the reconciled
  seed count) and `interval`; the live target count is per-pass (`repos` on
  the pass Info line would mislead — targets are table rows, not boot
  state). No
  per-issue logging — a 500-issue repo must not emit 500 lines per minute.

### Boot wiring + config (`server/serve.go`, `cmd/compass-server/main.go`)

Mirrors the two established precedents exactly:

- **Config surface:** `server.ServeConfig` (`serve.go:56-89`) gains an
  optional `Forge ForgeConfig` field, all-optional exactly like `S3`
  (`serve.go:71-75`): forge polling disabled → no driver, today's behavior,
  zero new requirements on existing deployments (the 0015 tables exist but
  sit empty — a migration is not a behavior change). The CLI (`main.go`)
  maps flags with env fallback mirroring the `COMPASS_S3_*` precedence
  (`main.go:127-138`): `--forge-repos` / `$COMPASS_FORGE_REPOS`
  (comma-separated `owner/name`) — now a declarative SEED for
  `forge_repo_subscriptions`, NOT the live subscription set;
  `--forge-poll-interval` / `$COMPASS_FORGE_POLL_INTERVAL` (default `1m`);
  `--forge-secret` / `$COMPASS_FORGE_SECRET` (the declared secret NAME,
  default `GITHUB_FORGE_TOKEN`; the VALUE never crosses a flag);
  `--forge-host` / `$COMPASS_FORGE_HOST` (default `github.com`, for GHES
  later; the API base URL derives from it); plus `--forge-poll` /
  `$COMPASS_FORGE_POLL` (bool, default false) to run the driver with an
  EMPTY seed (targets already in the table). Polling is enabled iff
  `--forge-poll` is set OR the seed list is non-empty; only then are the
  driver, the startup secret resolve, and the seed reconcile built.
- **Polling-disabled boot Warn:** when polling is DISABLED (`--forge-poll`
  unset AND an empty seed) but `forge_repo_subscriptions` holds `enabled`
  rows for the bound `(provider, host)`, boot emits ONE `slog.Warn` ("forge
  polling disabled but N enabled targets exist; set --forge-poll") — one
  query at boot (the store is already open at the gate decision), a warning
  and never fail-fast (a deployment that lands 0015 plus a manual row insert
  without the flag keeps today's no-driver behavior). The count covers ONLY
  the bound `(provider, host)`'s enabled rows, so it gives no false comfort
  about rows abandoned under a prior `--forge-host` (see the seed
  reconcile).
- **Seed reconcile (v1 population of `forge_repo_subscriptions`):** at boot,
  before the driver's first pass, each seed repo is INSERTED into
  `forge_repo_subscriptions` with `enabled = TRUE` under `ON CONFLICT … DO
  NOTHING` — a bootstrap-only insert: the flag creates rows that do not yet
  exist and leaves an existing row entirely untouched; the TABLE is
  authoritative after the first insert (Matt's OQ-C ruling intent — "needs
  to be easily able to add/remove repos" — read to its end: the table, not
  the flag, is the source of truth, dynamically). The seed is ADDITIVE,
  never destructive — doubly so: a repo present in the table but absent
  from the flag is NOT deleted and NOT disabled, AND a row an operator
  soft-disabled STAYS disabled across restarts regardless of the flag (the
  flag never flips an existing row's `enabled` — this eliminates the
  footgun where a repo soft-disabled during an incident, still listed in
  the deploy's `--forge-repos`, is silently re-enabled by a routine
  restart). Re-enabling, like removal, is a table operation
  (`SetForgeRepoSubscriptionEnabled` / SQL, or the future mutation
  surface). For GITHUB each seed repo string is lowercased before insert
  (the normalization rule in the DDL comment); renamed/transferred-repo
  drift (GitHub serves a 301 that `net/http` follows silently while the
  coordinate keeps the stale name) is OUT OF SCOPE for this slice. Seed
  rows are keyed under the configured `--forge-host`: changing
  `--forge-host` between boots ABANDONS (does not migrate) the prior
  host's rows — they stay present and enabled but are never polled (the
  adapter binds one `(provider, host)`), and the polling-disabled boot
  Warn above counts only the BOUND `(provider, host)`'s enabled rows. The
  live target set is ALWAYS the table (`WHERE enabled`, read per pass,
  T3); the flag only feeds it new rows. This keeps a zero-UI operational
  path for the MVP while the table supports dynamic add/remove; the
  mutation RPC/admin surface is a named non-goal (Global Constraints).
- **Secret resolve:** the driver's `TokenSource` closes over the one
  `secrets.SpecResolver` built at `serve.go:287`, calls
  `Resolve(ctx, "forge poll")` (`secrets/resolver.go:135`), and selects the
  configured name from the returned `[]ResolvedSecret` — the same
  single-resolve-surface DL-052 mandates; the row is declared `server_only`
  so it never reaches a container (mechanism per the ownership-layer T5,
  `compass-server-ownership-layer/design.md:1991-1995`). **Resolve is not
  cheap** — `resolver.go:135-165` reads the entire declared-secret registry
  from the store, writes a manifest temp file, and drives a full secretspec
  provider `Load` (potentially an external provider call) per invocation — so
  the `TokenSource` implementation caches the resolved value behind a short TTL
  (default `5m`); its `Invalidate()` (the T1 seam) drops the cached value so
  the next `Token` call re-resolves, and the client calls it on a
  `401`/bad-creds-`403` (Approach step 3). So a resolve happens on TTL expiry
  OR on an auth failure, NOT once per poll pass: a token that rotates rarely
  does not tax the store and secrets provider every minute, while a rotation
  still takes effect within the TTL (or immediately on the next auth failure).
  A startup resolve is attempted once when forge config is present, and its two
  failure modes get distinct error text so a crash-loop is diagnosable: an
  UNDECLARED/misnamed secret (the configured name is absent from the resolved
  set) is a permanent misconfiguration — `"forge secret %q not declared"`; a
  resolve that ERRORS at boot (secrets provider unreachable, store read
  failing) is transient — `"forge secret resolve failed at startup: %w"`. Both
  fail fast, but at `serve.go:287` the resolver is built AFTER the UDS listener
  binds, so the validation follows the listener-cleanup path the `Rehydrate`
  failure already uses (`serve.go:260-263`), returning the error from `Serve`
  rather than a bare `main.go` exit. A resolve that breaks at RUNTIME (provider
  outage, a declaration deleted post-boot) surfaces per-pass as an auth error
  → `slog.Error` + retry next tick (idempotent); to keep a permanently broken
  secret from degrading to silent forever-Error, the driver emits a distinct
  `slog.Error` "forge token unresolvable" the first time a resolve fails and
  on recovery — a minimal health surface without per-tick spam.
- **Poll-store adapter:** `serve.go` builds the small adapter satisfying
  `ingest.PollStore` over the already-open `*store.Store` (`st`), binding
  the driver's `(provider, host)` so the ingest-side interface stays
  repo-keyed. This is the store seam the ingest package's no-store rule
  requires (Global Constraints), following the established
  break-the-cycle/adapter convention of `wireHubServiceCycles`
  (`serve.go:298-301`).
- **Lifecycle:** the driver runs as one more `g.Go` member of the existing
  serve errgroup (`serve.go:327-339`) — `g.Go(func() error { return
  driver.Run(gctx) })` — so it inherits exactly the scoped lifecycle the
  doors have: cancelled on SIGINT/SIGTERM via the `signal.NotifyContext` ctx
  (`main.go:146-162`), first-error-wins, drained with everything else. No
  bespoke goroutine + done-channel machinery.
- **Ingester assembly:** `ingest.NewIngester(gh, issueBrd,
  &compassv1.ForgeRef{Provider: compassv1.ForgeProvider_FORGE_PROVIDER_GITHUB,
  Host: cfg.Forge.Host})` (`ingest.go:44`; enum at
  `gen/compass/v1/compass.pb.go:449`), where `issueBrd` is the existing
  projection instance built at `serve.go:259` — shared writer/reader exactly
  as the board pgtest drives it (`service_board_pgtest_test.go:13-15`).

## Alternatives considered

- **(a) go-github library — REJECTED (OQ-6, frozen Matt 2026-07-27).** It
  would add a dependency for what is ~300 LOC of `net/http`, and its
  high-level API lacks the hook this driver's core mechanism needs:
  first-class conditional-request (`If-None-Match`/304) handling fused with an
  `x-ratelimit-*` budget gate ahead of each call. Hand-rolling makes the
  budget/ETag path the PRIMARY path, not a retrofit around a library's
  transport. Not re-opened here; recorded as a Global Constraint.
- **(b) A distinct, simpler board-ingestion loop with an in-memory ETag cache
  (the pre-ruling Option 1 / Option 1.5) — CLOSED by Matt's OQ-A ruling,
  2026-08-07.** Option 1 left the DL-053 convergence asserted-not-designed
  (a per-LIST-PAGE in-memory ETag is not a per-artifact cursor behind a store
  seam — a later merge would be a fetch-layer rewrite) and left the PR-C
  double-fetch of `/issues` for a future decision; Option 1.5 made the cursor
  durable but still deferred the subscriber model. Matt ruled Option 2: build
  on the DL-053 machinery from day one so PR-C lands on one poll path and no
  convergence refactor is ever needed. This record is that build. See Open
  Questions → OQ-A (resolved).
- **(c) Webhooks instead of polling — deferred by DL-053 itself**
  ("change-detected by conditional polling in v1 (webhooks are an additive
  accelerator)", `DECISIONS.md:76`). Same posture applies here: a webhook
  receiver is an additive accelerator that sinks through the same
  `Ingester`, never a replacement for the poll.
- **(d) Where the loop lives: a bespoke goroutine in `cmd/compass-server`
  vs. the serve errgroup — chose the errgroup.** `main.go` owns flags and
  signal wiring only (`main.go:41-173`); everything with a lifecycle runs
  under `Serve`'s scoped group (`serve.go:321-339`). A cmd-level goroutine
  would duplicate drain/first-error semantics the group already audits.
- **(e) Per-repo goroutines in the driver — rejected.** One forge, one rate
  budget; sequential per-repo fetches serialize naturally against
  `x-ratelimit-*` and keep the driver a trivially testable single loop.
- **(f) `since`/`updated` incremental sync — still deferred, but its correct
  home now EXISTS.** A `since` watermark would shrink a CHANGED tick (ETag/304
  only makes the no-change tick free; a changed page pays a full paid refetch
  because GitHub's default `created`-desc order shifts page boundaries on
  insert). The pre-ruling record could not adopt it: an in-client watermark
  cannot observe the sink outcome, so advancing on fetch success strands
  un-sunk issues on a mid-pass sink failure (Global Constraints →
  Idempotency). Under Option 2 the driver owns a DURABLE, sink-gated cursor —
  a `since` watermark advanced only on full-walk success is now a small
  additive column on `forge_list_cursors`, correct by the same invariant. It
  is still NOT in this slice (v1 cost is bounded and budget-gated without
  it); it is recorded as the first cheap optimization the durable cursor
  unlocks, adoptable without design change.
- **(g) Widening the DL-053 subscription table to hold the board as a row
  (nullable `agent_account_id` + a subscriber-kind discriminator) —
  REJECTED; OQ-C resolved to a separate repo-level table instead.** It would
  make "the board is a subscriber" literal at the price of amending DL-053's
  spec'd shape (`agent_account_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES agent_accounts`,
  `compass-server-ownership-layer/design.md:980`) and forcing every future
  subscription query through a kind filter — for a subscriber that needs
  neither `delivered_revision` (its delivery is the in-pass sink) nor
  per-artifact granularity (its targets are whole repos). Matt's OQ-C ruling
  keeps the two concepts in two tables: `agent_forge_subscriptions` (the
  DL-053 per-artifact row, renamed) and `forge_repo_subscriptions` (the
  board's repo-level targets). See OQ-C.
- **(h) Seed conflict semantic `ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE SET enabled = TRUE`
  (flag-wins-for-its-members) — REJECTED in favor of `DO NOTHING`
  (bootstrap-only insert).** Under DO-UPDATE the flag re-enables any
  soft-disabled row still listed in `--forge-repos` at every boot, so
  KEEPING a repo disabled requires a config edit AND a redeploy —
  re-coupling the disable path to the deploy cycle, undoing exactly the
  runtime mutability the OQ-C table ruling bought — and a repo an operator
  soft-disabled during an incident is silently re-triggered by a routine
  restart. Under DO NOTHING the flag only bootstraps rows that do not
  exist; every subsequent state change is a table operation. Weighed here
  explicitly so the DO NOTHING choice is ratified knowingly at design-PR
  review (OQ-C).

## Plan

### T1 — `forge.GitHub`: the hand-rolled net/http GitHub read client

New file `go/internal/forge/github.go` (+ `github_test.go`). Carried over from
the pre-ruling cut with ONE structural change: the client is stateless about
cursors — the page-level primitive takes the caller's ETag and reports
`NotModified`; no in-memory ETag/response/Link cache exists. Implements the
request lifecycle from the Approach: bearer auth via `TokenSource`,
conditional GET per page, `x-ratelimit-*` budget gate with a typed budget
error + the 403 disambiguation rule, `per_page=100` + `Link`-header `HasNext`
detection, `IssueFilter` → query-param mapping (empty `State` → `state=all`),
`pull_request`-row exclusion, non-2xx → `*forge.StatusError`. Raw bodies pass
through untouched (`provider.go:42-44`). No `Provider` interface assertion —
read half only. One additive field: T1 widens `forge.Issue`
(`provider.go:37-53`) with `UpdatedAt time.Time`, parsed from the LIST row's
`updated_at`, so PR-C's DL-129 recency guard reads it off this same fetch
(Approach → one-fetch-path guarantee); the board sink ignores it.

Interfaces:

```go
// TokenSource yields the current forge token and lets the client drop a cached
// value when it observes an auth failure, so the next batch re-resolves. Token
// is called per fetch batch (not per request) so a rotated server_only secret
// takes effect without restart; the client calls Invalidate on a 401 /
// bad-creds-403 (Approach step 3). The T4 implementation is a TTL cache over
// the SpecResolver whose Invalidate drops the cached value (a bare func would
// have no seam to observe the auth failure through).
type TokenSource interface {
    Token(ctx context.Context) (string, error)
    Invalidate()
}

// GitHubConfig configures a GitHub read client.
type GitHubConfig struct {
    Host   string       // "github.com" or a GHES host; API base derives from it
    Token  TokenSource  // required
    Client *http.Client // nil -> a default client with a sane timeout
}

func NewGitHub(cfg GitHubConfig) *GitHub

// ListPage is one conditional page fetch result. On NotModified, Issues is
// nil and ETag/HasNext are zero — the caller's stored cursor row remains the
// truth for both.
type ListPage struct {
    Issues      []Issue
    ETag        string // the response ETag to store on sink success
    HasNext     bool   // an RFC-5988 Link rel="next" was present
    NotModified bool   // 304: content unchanged vs the etag argument
}

// ListIssuesPage fetches one page (1-based) conditionally: etag == "" is an
// unconditional fetch. The client holds NO cursor state — the caller owns it.
func (g *GitHub) ListIssuesPage(ctx context.Context, repo string, f IssueFilter, page int, etag string) (ListPage, error)

// ListIssues is the unconditional full walk (concatenated pages), built on
// ListIssuesPage. Satisfies ingest.forgeReader (ingest.go:23-25) structurally
// and is the read half of the eventual forge.Provider (provider.go:200).
func (g *GitHub) ListIssues(ctx context.Context, repo string, f IssueFilter) ([]Issue, error)

// ErrBudgetExhausted is returned (wrapped) when x-ratelimit-remaining is at or
// under the reserve; the caller skips the cycle and retries next tick.
var ErrBudgetExhausted = errors.New("forge: rate budget exhausted")
```

Consumes: `forge.IssueFilter` (`provider.go:182-188`), `forge.Issue`
(`provider.go:37-53`, widened here with `UpdatedAt`), `forge.StatusError`
(`provider.go:216-227`),
`net/http`, `encoding/json` (stdlib only — OQ-6).

Test cycle (unit, stubbed `http.RoundTripper`; red-first per repo convention):

1. 200 with issues JSON → parsed `[]forge.Issue` field-by-field (incl. raw
   body untouched, labels, state, ForgeAccount, and `UpdatedAt` parsed from
   the row's `updated_at`).
2. `ListIssuesPage` with a non-empty `etag` sends `If-None-Match`; a scripted
   304 returns `NotModified: true` with nil Issues and no body parse; an
   empty `etag` sends NO `If-None-Match` header.
3. `x-ratelimit-remaining: 0` on response N → call N+1 fails
   `errors.Is(..., ErrBudgetExhausted)` WITHOUT issuing a request (assert via
   RoundTripper call count); after scripted reset, calls resume.
4. `HasNext` is true exactly when a `Link: rel="next"` header is present;
   `per_page=100` and the requested `page` land on the wire; `ListIssues`
   concatenates a scripted two-page walk in order.
5. Empty `IssueFilter.State` → `state=all` on the wire; labels join correctly.
6. A `pull_request`-keyed row is dropped.
7. 404/500, and a 403 WITHOUT rate-limit headers (a bad-credentials/permission
   `message`) → `errors.As(..., *forge.StatusError)` with matching Status and
   the GitHub `message` field, AND the client calls `Invalidate()` on a fake
   `TokenSource` exactly once (the 401/bad-creds-403 discriminator of Approach
   step 3 — asserted on the ABSENCE of `retry-after`/zeroed
   `x-ratelimit-remaining`, so a rate-limit 403 does NOT call `Invalidate`).
8. Token from `TokenSource` lands as `Authorization: Bearer …`; a TokenSource
   error propagates without a request.
9. `403`/`429` with `retry-after` (or a zeroed `x-ratelimit-remaining` on the
   prior response) → next call fails `errors.Is(..., ErrBudgetExhausted)`
   without issuing a request (RoundTripper call count asserted).
10. Absent/malformed `x-ratelimit-*` headers do not wedge the gate — the
    client proceeds (treats unknown budget as available) rather than
    permanently skipping.
11. ctx cancellation mid-`ListIssues`-walk (cancel after page 1) stops
    promptly and returns `ctx.Err()`, not a partial concatenation.
12. Reverify against current GitHub REST docs that a 304 is not charged
    against the core rate limit; record the doc URL + date in the client's
    doc comment (the budget math depends on it).

### T2 — migration `0015_forge_subscriptions.sql` + the target/cursor store layer

New migration `go/internal/store/migrations/0015_forge_subscriptions.sql` and
new file `go/internal/store/forge_cursors.go` (+
`forge_cursors_pgtest_test.go`, build-tag gated like the sibling
`*_pgtest_test.go` suites). The migration creates all FOUR tables
unconditionally (OQ-D1 resolved land-now): `forge_repo_subscriptions` +
`forge_list_cursors` (DDL in the Approach) + the two DL-053-spec'd tables
(`agent_forge_subscriptions` — renamed from the spec's `forge_subscriptions`
— and `forge_artifact_cursors`, adapted from
`compass-server-ownership-layer/design.md:976-1019`, renumbered from that
record's stale `0004_forge` label, keys aligned to the 0013 issue-coordinate
convention: SMALLINT provider enum + `forge_host` in every key; every
provider CHECK admits `IN (1, 2, 3, 4)` per OQ-D2). Store methods cover the
list cursor AND `forge_repo_subscriptions` in this slice — the driver reads
targets from it and the T4 boot reconcile inserts new rows into it (`ON
CONFLICT DO NOTHING`);
`agent_forge_subscriptions` / `forge_artifact_cursors` get their store
surface with their writers (the agent-notification slice / PR-C).

One enum-constant note: `store.ForgeProvider` today stops at Forgejo —
`ForgeProviderUnspecified=0, GitHub=1, GitLab=2, Forgejo=3`
(`store/issues.go:30-35`), and its mirror comment (`issues.go:26-27`) omits
Linear even though the proto declares `FORGE_PROVIDER_LINEAR = 4`
(`gen/compass/v1/compass.pb.go:452`). T2 adds `ForgeProviderLinear
ForgeProvider = 4` (and updates the mirror comment) so the Go domain matches
the 0015 CHECK domain; no behavior change — no producer passes 4 this slice
(the T4 wiring is GITHUB-only) — but a store-level constant must exist for a
domain the schema admits.

Interfaces:

```go
// package store

// ForgeListPageCursor is one durable page row of a repo's issue-LIST fetch
// cursor (the DL-053 FETCH-cursor model at repo-LIST granularity). ETag ""
// means never fetched (an unconditional GET).
type ForgeListPageCursor struct {
    Provider ForgeProvider // GITHUB(1)/GITLAB(2)/FORGEJO(3)/LINEAR(4); never 0
    Host     string
    Repo     string
    Page     int32 // 1-based
    ETag     string
    HasNext  bool
}

// ForgeListCursor reads every stored page row for the repo, ascending page.
// No rows is a nil slice, not an error (a never-polled repo).
func (s *Store) ForgeListCursor(ctx context.Context, provider ForgeProvider, host, repo string) ([]ForgeListPageCursor, error)

// UpsertForgeListCursorPage inserts-or-updates one page row (touching
// advanced_at — the last CONTENT advance, since this is called only after a
// 200+sink; an all-304 tick rewrites no row). Called by the driver ONLY after
// the page's content durably sank
// — the advance-attests-sink invariant lives in the caller; the store method
// is a plain upsert. Zero/empty coordinate fields -> ErrInvalidArgument.
func (s *Store) UpsertForgeListCursorPage(ctx context.Context, cur ForgeListPageCursor) error

// PruneForgeListCursorPages deletes the repo's page rows with page > maxPage
// (a repo whose walk shrank). maxPage < 1 -> ErrInvalidArgument.
func (s *Store) PruneForgeListCursorPages(ctx context.Context, provider ForgeProvider, host, repo string, maxPage int32) error

// ForgeRepoSubscription is one board poll target: a repo the poll driver
// walks (OQ-C's table model). Enabled=false soft-disables the target without
// deleting its cursor history.
type ForgeRepoSubscription struct {
    Provider ForgeProvider
    Host     string
    Repo     string
    Enabled  bool
}

// EnsureForgeRepoSubscription inserts the target if absent; on conflict it
// DOES NOTHING — the T4 seed reconcile is a bootstrap-only insert and the
// table is authoritative after the first insert (the seed never deletes,
// disables, or re-enables an existing row).
// Zero/empty coordinate fields -> ErrInvalidArgument.
func (s *Store) EnsureForgeRepoSubscription(ctx context.Context, sub ForgeRepoSubscription) error

// ListEnabledForgeRepoSubscriptions reads the enabled targets for one
// (provider, host), ascending repo — the driver's per-pass target
// enumeration. No rows is a nil slice, not an error.
func (s *Store) ListEnabledForgeRepoSubscriptions(ctx context.Context, provider ForgeProvider, host string) ([]ForgeRepoSubscription, error)

// SetForgeRepoSubscriptionEnabled flips one target's enabled bit, touching
// updated_at (the soft-disable path; the admin mutation surface is a later
// slice's — this method exists for it, for operators via SQL parity, and
// for tests).
// Unknown coordinate -> ErrNotFound; zero/empty fields -> ErrInvalidArgument.
func (s *Store) SetForgeRepoSubscriptionEnabled(ctx context.Context, provider ForgeProvider, host, repo string, enabled bool) error
```

Consumes: the migration runner + `pgtest` harness the sibling suites use
(`store/issues_pgtest_test.go` et al.), `ErrInvalidArgument` /
`ErrNotFound` (the store's existing sentinels — the `issues.go:103-108` and
`issues.go:151-153` patterns).

Test cycle (pgtest, isolated schema per case like `issues_pgtest_test.go`):

1. Migration applies cleanly from empty AND from a 0014 database (the
   sequential-migration harness proves both); all four tables exist with
   their PKs and CHECKs (page CHECK rejects 0; kind CHECKs reject 0/3).
2. Provider CHECK domain, proven on `forge_repo_subscriptions` AND
   `forge_list_cursors`: providers 1..4 each insert cleanly; 0 and 5 are
   each rejected — the CHECK admits the full declared enum and nothing else
   (OQ-D2 at the schema).
3. `ForgeListCursor` on a never-polled repo → nil, no error.
4. Upsert page 1 then re-upsert with a new ETag → one row, new ETag,
   `advanced_at` advanced; rows come back ascending by page.
5. Two hosts / two providers with the same `repo` string do not collide (the
   coordinate rationale, proven).
6. `PruneForgeListCursorPages(maxPage=2)` on a 4-page repo leaves pages 1-2;
   pruning a never-polled repo is a no-op.
7. `agent_forge_subscriptions` FK shape: inserting a row with an unknown
   `agent_account_id` fails (RESTRICT, per the DL-053 DDL and the
   0006-established convention `0006_delivery_cursors.sql:6-9`) — the table
   is writer-less this slice but its shape is proven here. Unconditional
   (OQ-D1 resolved land-now).
8. Repo-subscription CRUD: ensure-insert creates the row enabled;
   re-ensure of the same coordinate is idempotent (one row); ensure-insert
   over a soft-disabled row leaves it DISABLED (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` —
   the bootstrap-only semantic; this leg goes RED against a DO-UPDATE
   regression); `ListEnabledForgeRepoSubscriptions` returns only enabled
   rows for the asked (provider, host), ascending repo, and nil for none;
   `SetForgeRepoSubscriptionEnabled(false)` removes the row from the
   enabled list WITHOUT deleting it and advances `updated_at` (the audit
   column); unknown coordinate → `ErrNotFound`.
9. Invalid input: zero provider / empty host / empty repo / page 0 →
   `ErrInvalidArgument` on each method (cursor and subscription both).

### T3 — `ingest.Driver`: the DL-053 conditional-poll driver

New file `go/internal/ingest/driver.go` (+ `driver_test.go`), plus one
refactor inside `ingest.go`: extract the translate+sink loop of `Ingest`
(`ingest.go:58-63`) into `IngestIssues(ctx, repo, raws)` so the driver can
feed caller-fetched page batches through the existing per-issue pipeline;
`Ingest` becomes `ListIssues` + `IngestIssues` (behavior unchanged — the
existing `ingest_test.go` suite is the regression net). Each pass begins
with a fresh target enumeration (`PollStore.ListEnabledRepos` — the
`forge_repo_subscriptions WHERE enabled` read, bound to the driver's
provider+host by the T4 adapter), so a target added or disabled between
ticks takes effect on the next pass with no restart. Pass algorithm,
page-wise cursor advance, budget/error classification, logging per the
Approach; `nil` return on ctx cancellation.

Interfaces:

```go
// package ingest

// IngestIssues translates + sinks a caller-fetched batch of raw issues for
// repo: the loop body of Ingest, exposed so the DL-053 driver (which fetches
// page-wise to gate cursor advance on sink success) reuses the one pipeline.
// Stops and returns the first sink error (wrapped); partial progress is fine —
// a re-poll is idempotent on the coordinate.
func (in *Ingester) IngestIssues(ctx context.Context, repo string, raws []forge.Issue) error

// ListPageCursor is the driver's view of one durable page-cursor row.
type ListPageCursor struct {
    Page    int
    ETag    string
    HasNext bool
}

// PollStore is the durable target + FETCH-cursor surface the driver needs
// — a narrow, repo-keyed structural seam (the server wiring adapts
// *store.Store and binds provider+host), keeping this package's no-store
// property (ingest.go:7-8). Named for the whole surface the poller uses:
// its first method is target enumeration, not cursor state.
// ListEnabledRepos is the per-pass target enumeration
// (forge_repo_subscriptions WHERE enabled — OQ-C's table model); the three
// cursor methods are the page-cursor surface.
type PollStore interface {
    ListEnabledRepos(ctx context.Context) ([]string, error)
    ListCursor(ctx context.Context, repo string) ([]ListPageCursor, error)
    UpsertListCursorPage(ctx context.Context, repo string, cur ListPageCursor) error
    PruneListCursorPages(ctx context.Context, repo string, maxPage int) error
}

// pageLister is the fetch seam: the page-level conditional read of the forge
// client (satisfied by *forge.GitHub structurally; faked in tests).
type pageLister interface {
    ListIssuesPage(ctx context.Context, repo string, f forge.IssueFilter, page int, etag string) (forge.ListPage, error)
}

// DriverConfig configures the board-ingestion poll driver. The target repos
// are NOT config — the driver reads them from PollStore.ListEnabledRepos
// at the top of every pass.
type DriverConfig struct {
    Interval time.Duration // > 0; the caller defaults it
    Log      *slog.Logger  // nil -> slog.Default()
}

func NewDriver(client pageLister, ing *Ingester, cursors PollStore, cfg DriverConfig) *Driver

// Run polls until ctx is cancelled, then returns nil (clean shutdown).
// Per-repo errors are logged and retried next tick, never returned — a
// re-poll is idempotent on the coordinate (ingest.go:48-52).
func (d *Driver) Run(ctx context.Context) error
```

Consumes: `Ingester` (`ingest.go:35-46`), `forge.ListPage` /
`forge.ErrBudgetExhausted` (T1), `time.Ticker`, `log/slog`.

Test cycle (unit, fake `pageLister` + fake `PollStore` + the package's
existing `recordingSink` pattern, `ingest_test.go:13-27`):

1. `Run` performs an immediate pass over every enabled target
   (`ListEnabledRepos` faked) before the first tick (short interval, assert
   call order/coverage).
2. ctx cancel BETWEEN ticks → `Run` returns `nil` promptly, and ctx cancel
   DURING a pass also returns `nil` promptly — deadline-gated, never a sleep
   (the pgtest convention, `service_board_pgtest_test.go:15`). Assert `Run`
   does NOT return while ctx is live (it has no non-cancel exit).
3. Conditional walk: stored cursors `{1: e1 hasNext, 2: e2}` → page 1 fetched
   with `etag=e1`; a scripted 304 on page 1 still walks to page 2 (the
   stored `HasNext`, not the response, carries the chain); an all-304 pass
   sinks nothing and upserts nothing.
4. **Cursor advance gated on sink success (defends the Idempotency
   invariant):** a 200 page of N issues whose sink fails at issue k →
   `UpsertListCursorPage` is NOT called for that page and the pass aborts for
   that repo; next tick re-fetches the page with the OLD etag and every issue
   k..N sinks — none stranded. On full-page sink success the upsert carries
   the response ETag + HasNext.
5. Prune: a walk that ends at page 2 after cursors held 4 pages calls
   `PruneListCursorPages(repo, 2)`; an aborted (error/budget) pass never
   prunes.
6. A scripted failure on repo A does not stop repo B in the same pass, and
   repo A is retried on the next tick.
7. Budget skip: `ErrBudgetExhausted` from the fetch → Warn (not Error), pass
   abandoned, pages already advanced this pass stay advanced.
8. Interval respected: N ticks in a bounded window drive exactly N+1 passes
   (the +1 is the immediate pass); no busy-loop.
9. Log fields: capture a `slog` test handler and assert a happy pass logs at
   Info with `repo`/`issues`/`pages`/`dur`, a budget-skip logs at Warn, and a
   genuine error logs at Error with `err`.
10. `IngestIssues` refactor regression: `Ingest` still fetches-then-sinks
    identically (existing `ingest_test.go` cases stay green unmodified), and
    `IngestIssues` on a batch stops at the first sink error with the same
    wrapped error shape (`ingest.go:60-62`).
11. Per-pass target enumeration is live: a repo added to the fake
    `ListEnabledRepos` result between ticks is polled on the next pass; a
    repo removed/disabled between ticks is not; zero targets → an idle pass
    (no fetch, no sink, no Error log).
12. `ListEnabledRepos` returning an error → `slog.Error`, the pass is
    skipped, `Run` keeps ticking (never fatal), and the next tick
    re-enumerates.

### T4 — serve boot wiring + config surface + secret resolve

Touches `server/serve.go`, `cmd/compass-server/main.go` (edits only, no new
files beyond tests). `ServeConfig.Forge` all-optional like `S3`; CLI
flags/env per the Approach; the boot seed reconcile that inserts
`--forge-repos` into `forge_repo_subscriptions` (bootstrap-only, `ON
CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, before the driver's first pass); the polling-disabled
boot Warn (the Approach's boot-Warn bullet); fail-fast on
forge-polling-enabled but secret-unresolvable; the `ingest.PollStore`
adapter over the open
`*store.Store`; driver under the existing errgroup.

Interfaces:

```go
// server.ForgeConfig configures the board-ingestion poll driver (SEA-1810).
// All-optional: polling disabled (empty SeedRepos, Poll false) leaves the
// driver off (today's behavior).
type ForgeConfig struct {
    Host         string        // default "github.com"
    SeedRepos    []string      // "owner/name" (--forge-repos): boot-reconciled
                               // into forge_repo_subscriptions (bootstrap-only
                               // insert, ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING; lowercased
                               // for GITHUB) — a SEED, not the live target set
    Poll         bool          // --forge-poll: run the driver even with an
                               // empty seed (targets already in the table)
    SecretName   string        // declared server_only secret name; default "GITHUB_FORGE_TOKEN"
    PollInterval time.Duration // default time.Minute
}
// ServeConfig gains: Forge ForgeConfig; polling enabled iff
// Poll || len(SeedRepos) > 0

// unexported in server/: the ingest.PollStore adapter binding the driver's
// forge coordinate half, so the ingest-side seam stays repo-keyed.
type forgePollStore struct {
    st       *store.Store
    provider store.ForgeProvider
    host     string
}
// satisfies ingest.PollStore: ListEnabledRepos (→ the T2
// ListEnabledForgeRepoSubscriptions, mapped to repo strings) / ListCursor /
// UpsertListCursorPage / PruneListCursorPages, each delegating to the T2
// store methods with the bound (provider, host).
```

Consumes: `secrets.SpecResolver.Resolve(ctx, reason) ([]ResolvedSecret, error)`
(`secrets/resolver.go:135`), `secrets.ResolvedSecret{Name, Value, …}`
(`secrets/secrets.go:132-135`; Value redacted under all fmt verbs — safe to
thread), the `board.NewIssueProjection` instance from `serve.go:259`,
`ingest.NewIngester` (`ingest.go:44`), `forge.NewGitHub` (T1), the T2 store
methods, `ingest.NewDriver`/`Run` (T3), the errgroup at `serve.go:327`,
`compassv1.ForgeProvider_FORGE_PROVIDER_GITHUB`
(`gen/compass/v1/compass.pb.go:449`).

Produces: a `TokenSource` closure over the resolver that re-resolves +
selects `SecretName` on TTL expiry or auth failure (not per pass; see the
Secret-resolve bullet); the boot seed reconcile (each `SeedRepos` entry
lowercased for GITHUB and inserted enabled into `forge_repo_subscriptions`
via the T2 ensure-insert, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, before the driver's
first pass); the polling-disabled boot Warn; the poll-store adapter;
boot-time validation
error text for missing-secret / bad-repo-format / non-positive interval.

Test cycle:

1. Unit: CLI flag/env precedence for the five forge knobs (repos seed, poll
   enable, interval, secret name, host) mirrors the S3 pattern (table test
   like `resolveNetworkDoor`'s, `main.go:184-212`); repo-format validation
   (`owner/name`) rejects garbage at startup; case normalization: a seed of
   `Owner/Name` reconciles to ONE lowercased `owner/name` row, never two PK
   rows.
2. Unit: forge polling disabled (empty `SeedRepos`, `Poll` false) → `Serve`
   builds no driver and attempts no secret resolve (assert via config
   plumbing seam, no behavioral change to existing serve tests — the whole
   existing suite is the regression net; the 0015 migration alone must not
   change any existing test's outcome); `Poll` true with an empty seed →
   the driver IS built (table-driven targets, idle passes until rows exist);
   polling disabled with enabled `forge_repo_subscriptions` rows present
   for the bound (provider, host) → boot emits exactly ONE `slog.Warn`
   ("forge polling disabled but N enabled targets exist"; capture a slog
   test handler), and no Warn when no enabled rows exist.
3. pgtest (build-tag gated like the board suite): a `Serve`-assembled
   pipeline over a fake pager scripted with one issue page sinks to the real
   projection, lands in `ListBoardIssues`, AND leaves a
   `forge_list_cursors` page-1 row carrying the scripted ETag — the
   end-to-end boot-wiring + durable-cursor proof without touching live
   GitHub. The target repo enters via the seed reconcile, and the ordering
   assertion is DIRECT: assert the seeded `forge_repo_subscriptions` row is
   visible BEFORE the fake pager's first call (instrument the fake pager to
   snapshot the row at call time, or — if the harness can shrink the
   interval — assert explicit call ordering), not merely inferred from a
   1m-interval timeout.
4. pgtest (restart-resync proof — the durable cursor's headline buy): after
   test 3, rebuild the pipeline over the SAME schema (a "restart") with the
   pager scripting a 304 for the stored ETag; assert the pass issues no
   unconditional fetch, sinks nothing, and the projection still serves the
   issue (Rehydrate covers the read side, `serve.go:259-263`).
5. pgtest (the no-clobber contract's runtime proof — the test MUST be able to
   go RED): (1) ingest/create the issue via the projection, (2) set a
   non-default lifecycle `State` through the part-5 write path
   (`store.SetIssueState`, `issues.go:140`), (3) re-ingest a forge UPDATE for
   the same coordinate (forge_state open→closed) via the fake pager, (4)
   assert `ForgeState` is updated AND `State` is unchanged from the human-set
   value (`issue_projection.go:208`, `protoToForgeFields` writes `ForgeState`
   but never `State`). A regression adding `state = EXCLUDED.state` to the
   `UpsertIssueForgeFields` SET clause (`issues.go:121-125`) MUST turn this
   red — the as-worded "State left untouched" over a zero-value row would stay
   green vacuously, so the human-set baseline in step 2 is load-bearing.
6. Unit: the T4 `TokenSource` re-resolves after its TTL, and calling its
   `Invalidate()` drops the cached value so the next `Token` re-resolves and
   the changed resolver value is used on the next fetch — the design's stated
   reason for a TTL-cache `TokenSource` with an invalidation seam rather than a
   captured token or a bare func.
7. Startup failure, two distinct texts: (a) forge polling enabled + secret NAME
   absent from the resolved set → `Serve` returns `"forge secret %q not
   declared"`; (b) the resolve call itself ERRORS at boot → `Serve` returns
   `"forge secret resolve failed at startup: %w"`. Both follow the
   listener-cleanup path the `Rehydrate` failure uses (`serve.go:260-263`),
   since the resolver is built after the UDS listener binds (`serve.go:287`);
   assert the two error strings are distinguishable so a permanent misconfig is
   not confused with a transient provider outage.
8. pgtest (the seed-reconcile semantic — bootstrap-only insert, `ON
   CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, never destructive and never mutating; this test
   MUST be able to go RED against both a destructive-sync and a DO-UPDATE
   regression): reconcile with seed `{a/b, c/d}` → both rows enabled;
   insert `e/f` directly (the "table-added" repo) and re-run the reconcile
   with seed `{a/b}` → `c/d` and `e/f` BOTH survive, still enabled (a repo
   dropped from the flag is NOT auto-deleted or disabled); disable `c/d`
   via `SetForgeRepoSubscriptionEnabled(false)` and re-run the reconcile
   with `c/d` STILL in the seed → `c/d` STAYS disabled (the flag never
   flips an existing row's `enabled`; this leg goes RED against a
   DO-UPDATE-SET-enabled regression); disable `e/f` (absent from the seed)
   and re-run → stays disabled.

## Tasks

- [ ] **T1** — `forge.GitHub` read client (`github.go` + unit tests over a
  stubbed RoundTripper: 200/parse incl. `UpdatedAt`, conditional
  `ListIssuesPage`/304, budget gate + 403 disambiguation + `TokenSource.
  Invalidate` on bad-creds, `HasNext`/pagination, filter mapping incl.
  `state=all` default, PR exclusion, StatusError mapping, bearer auth,
  304-uncharged doc reverify).
- [ ] **T2** — migration `0015_forge_subscriptions.sql` (all four tables
  unconditionally: `forge_repo_subscriptions` + `forge_list_cursors` +
  `agent_forge_subscriptions` + `forge_artifact_cursors`,
  coordinate-aligned, every provider CHECK `IN (1, 2, 3, 4)`) +
  `store/forge_cursors.go` list-cursor + repo-subscription methods +
  `store.ForgeProviderLinear = 4`; pgtest-covered (incl. the CHECK-domain
  and FK-shape proofs).
- [ ] **T3** — `ingest.Driver` conditional-poll driver (`driver.go` + the
  `IngestIssues` extraction in `ingest.go`; unit tests: immediate pass, ctx
  cancel → nil, per-pass target enumeration via `ListEnabledRepos`,
  conditional walk over stored cursors, sink-gated cursor advance, prune,
  per-repo error isolation, budget-skip classification, interval
  discipline, slog fields).
- [ ] **T4** — serve boot wiring: `ServeConfig.Forge` (seed + poll-enable),
  CLI flags/env, the boot seed reconcile into `forge_repo_subscriptions`
  (bootstrap-only insert, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`), the polling-disabled
  boot Warn, DL-052 secret resolve via the existing `SpecResolver`,
  the `ingest.PollStore` adapter over `*store.Store`, errgroup
  membership, fail-fast validation; unit + pgtest end-to-end incl. the
  durable-cursor restart proof, the no-clobber proof, and the
  seed-reconcile semantic.

## Open Questions

### OQ-A — RESOLVED (Matt, 2026-08-07): Option 2

Matt ruled **Option 2**: this driver is built ON the DL-053 subscription
machinery from day one — the board as a distinguished DL-053 subscriber over
the per-artifact FETCH-cursor model's durable Postgres cursors — so
tracker-status ingestion (PR-C, per DL-129) lands on one poll path, no
convergence refactor is ever needed, and the PR-C `/issues` double-fetch never
arises. The T1 GitHub read client survives the ruling nearly intact (it is the
shared fetch half either way; its one structural change — cursor state moves
out of the client into `forge_list_cursors` — is the Approach's stateless-client
bullet). The superseded Option 1 / Option 1.5 framings and their tradeoffs are
retained in Alternatives (b) for the reasoning trail; the fork is closed and
is not relitigated here. The follow-on shape calls INSIDE Option 2 were OQ-C
and OQ-D — both since RESOLVED (Matt, 2026-08-08), below.

### OQ-C — RESOLVED (Matt, 2026-08-08): the board's subscription set is a TABLE

Matt: "needs to be easily able to add/remove repos, so I think it needs to
be a table? It can be a different one than forge_subscriptions if needed, or
that can be renamed to agent_forge_subscriptions, etc."

Resolution, as applied through this record:

- **New table `forge_repo_subscriptions`** — the board's repo-level poll
  targets, keyed `(forge_provider, forge_host, repo)`, with `enabled
  BOOLEAN` for soft-disable (DDL in the Approach). The driver enumerates
  `WHERE enabled` at the top of every pass (T3), so add/remove is a row
  operation, live at the next tick, no restart and no deploy.
- **DL-053's `forge_subscriptions` lands RENAMED
  `agent_forge_subscriptions`** (Matt's explicit option) — shape unchanged;
  the rename disambiguates the per-ARTIFACT, agent-owned subscription from
  the board's per-REPO target (Global Constraints). The rename lands as a
  two-half freeze-time delta, SPLIT across this PR and a follow-up: (a) a
  DECISIONS.md ledger row recording the table model + the rename — this is
  DL-163, and it RIDES THIS PR; and (b) a one-line forward annotation at the
  ownership-layer DDL (`compass-server-ownership-layer/design.md:978`, above
  the `CREATE TABLE forge_subscriptions`) — "lands as
  `agent_forge_subscriptions`; see compass-forge-poll-driver" — so a reader
  entering from the frozen ownership-layer record who greps
  `forge_subscriptions` finds the mapping instead of nothing. Half (b) is
  DEFERRED to SEA-1883, not folded here: it edits a frozen Active record,
  which needs Matt's explicit call (flagged in OQ-C for his ratification at
  this design-PR review). This PR's ledger delta is DL-161/DL-162/DL-163 in
  DECISIONS.md.
- **v1 population is the T4 boot seed reconcile** — `--forge-repos`
  inserted enabled where absent, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`: additive, never
  destructive, never mutating an existing row — and the dynamic mutation
  RPC/admin surface is a named non-goal of this slice. The ON CONFLICT
  semantic is author-resolved to DO NOTHING (the DO-UPDATE-SET-enabled
  alternative is weighed and rejected in Alternatives (h)); flagged for
  Matt's ratification at design-PR review.

For the trail: this record previously RECOMMENDED config-declared
(`ForgeConfig.Repos` as the subscription set, no rows); Matt ruled it out
because the target set must be mutable at runtime without a deploy. The
widened-subscription-row alternative stays rejected (Alternatives (g)). The
one-fetch-path guarantee is unaffected — it hangs on `forge_list_cursors` +
the shared pass, not on where the target set lives. The board still holds NO
delivery cursor: its notify is the synchronous in-pass sink, so that half of
the original question resolves unchanged (Approach (a)).

### OQ-D — RESOLVED (Matt, 2026-08-08): all four tables land now; CHECKs admit the full enum

**D1 — land-now.** Migration 0015 unconditionally lands
`forge_repo_subscriptions`, `forge_list_cursors`,
`agent_forge_subscriptions`, and `forge_artifact_cursors` (Approach → the
four forge tables). The defer alternative (each spec'd table rides its first
writer) is closed; T2 test 7 — the FK-shape proof on the writer-less
`agent_forge_subscriptions` — is unconditional. The coordinate alignment
(SMALLINT provider + `forge_host` in every key, per `0013_issues.sql:29-35`)
was never the fork and stands as author-decided.

**D2 — every provider CHECK admits the FULL declared enum, `IN (1, 2, 3,
4)`.** Matt: "why did we drop linear? we need linear for dogfood, linear and
github. gitlab/forgejo can come later in beta etc." The earlier
recommendation here — narrow to `{github, gitlab, forgejo}` to match the
0013 coordinate — was WRONG and is corrected: it dropped Linear, which
dogfood needs, and it mistook the CHECK for a rollout gate. The CHECK's job
is "never UNSPECIFIED(0)"; rollout is gated by which `forge.Provider` has a
real client (GitHub only, this slice — no producer for gitlab/forgejo/linear
issues exists in the tree). The proto enum already declares all four
providers (`FORGE_PROVIDER_LINEAR = 4`, `proto/compass/v1/compass.proto:704`
— "DL-051's issues-only forge source: a Linear-origin Issue whose repo is
the project key"), so the 0015 tables admit the whole declared domain (never
a non-contiguous subset like `IN (1, 4)`) and the future Linear slice needs
no CHECK-widening migration on any of them. The `issues` table's own
`IN (1, 2, 3)` is the separate prerequisite documented as OQ-E.

### OQ-E (out of scope — the Linear-ingestion prerequisite; follow-up filed by the driver)

SEA-1810's new tables are Linear-ready (their CHECKs admit 4), but actually
INGESTING Linear issues has three prerequisites, ALL out of scope for this
GitHub-read slice and belonging to the future Linear-ingestion slice:

- **The `issues` CHECK:** `0013_issues.sql:32` is `forge_provider SMALLINT
  NOT NULL CHECK (forge_provider IN (1, 2, 3))` — "GitHub/GitLab/Forgejo;
  never UNSPECIFIED(0)". It EXCLUDES Linear(4): the projection cannot store
  a Linear-provider issue today. Widening it to `IN (1, 2, 3, 4)` is one
  migration on that ONE table.
- **The store Go enum:** `store.ForgeProvider` constants stop at
  `ForgeProviderForgejo = 3` (`store/issues.go:30-35`). T2 already adds
  `ForgeProviderLinear = 4` so the Go domain matches the 0015 CHECK domain —
  this half is closed by this slice; the future slice adds its producer.
- **A Linear `forge.Provider` client** (DL-051, `DECISIONS.md:129`: the
  forge adapter is "GitHub first, Linear issues-only"; `ForgeRef.host` for
  Linear is the constant "linear.app", `compass.proto:711-712`).

Because the 0015 tables already admit 4, that future slice touches the ONE
`issues` CHECK plus a client — not the whole forge-table set. The driver
files the follow-up issue; this record only documents the prerequisite. Not
load-bearing for this slice's freeze.

Why the asymmetry (`issues` CHECK deferred in SQL, Go domain closed now) is
deliberate: the Go constant `store.ForgeProviderLinear = 4` is required THIS
slice because 0015's own store methods must be able to name domain value 4
(the four new tables' CHECKs admit it), while the `issues` CHECK guards a
table SEA-1810 never writes with provider=4 (the driver is bound to GITHUB;
no Linear producer exists in the tree) — and widening a guard ahead of its
producer would weaken 0013's "every issue is forge-backed" documentation, so
the widening correctly waits for the Linear producer. This deferral is
author-resolved pending Matt's review: he may tie-break to fold the
`issues`-CHECK widening into 0015 if he prefers SQL/Go symmetry.

### OQ-B (non-load-bearing deferral): live-demo content

Whether the dogfood demo shows LIVE GitHub issues — which would make this
driver demo-critical and re-sequence its priority — is a later Matt scope
call per the SEA-1810 issue body's own escalation trip-wire. Recorded as an
explicitly non-load-bearing deferral: the design is correct regardless of the
ruling; only scheduling changes.
