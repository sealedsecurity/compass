// Dev-only stub data for the Compass ADE UI.
//
// Compass is an Agentic Development Environment: a persistent daemon (compassd)
// with a Tauri shell rendering this web UI, meeting at the compass.v1 gRPC
// contract (docs/specs/product/compass.md). The real board / agent / ACP /
// audit event payloads are not built yet — the daemon today reports liveness and
// a daemon-status stream — so this module hand-fakes a representative fleet so
// the full interface is explorable in `vite dev` with no daemon and no Tauri IPC.
//
// Everything here is a plain in-memory fixture. When the daemon grows the board,
// agent-runtime (ACP over compass.v1, design record compass-0.4), and audit
// streams, this module is deleted and the components read the generated
// @compass/client instead — the shapes below intentionally mirror that eventual
// contract. The data is drawn from a real multi-agent wave so it reads true.
