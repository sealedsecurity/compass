// Dev-only stub data for the Compass UI.
//
// Compass is a Discord/Slack-style multi-agent product: humans and agents
// talk in channels + DMs, and — once inside an agent workspace — that channel
// chat is the workspace's primary pane, with the agent's execution trace a
// secondary observation companion beside it (design compass-0.7). Humans
// and agents are first-class accounts; channels nest in channel groups
// (a user's space, e.g. group "matt" -> channel "coordination").
//
// This module mirrors the compass.v1 comms contract
// (proto/compass/v1/comms.proto): Account / ChannelGroup / Channel / Message /
// MessageBlock / Ask. It is the walking-skeleton fixture — the shell renders it
// through the comms store with no daemon, and when SubscribeComms lands this
// module is deleted and the components read the generated @compass/client
// instead (the shapes below intentionally mirror that eventual contract).
//
// Reframe deltas vs the raw proto, each annotated at its seam:
//  - the durable conversation block set narrows to `text` + `ask`. The rich ACP
//    blocks (thought/tool_call/plan/diff) do NOT appear in the channel — they
//    live in the session observation panel, rendered by OMP's own renderer over
//    opaque session frames.
//  - threading is TWO-LEVEL (Zulip model): a channel holds named `Topic`s, and
//    each `Message` belongs to exactly one topic (`Message.topicId`). There is
//    no per-message parent — a topic IS the thread. (comms.proto Message.topic_id
//    + Topic; field 2 reused as topic_id, parent_message_id removed.)
//  - per-channel membership (joined / subscribed) is a still-in-design contract
//    carrier — modeled here as a UI-side field. SEAM: expect the field name to
//    settle.

// ── Accounts (comms.proto Account) ───────────────────────────────────────────

// The account identity model is owned by stub-data.ts (the roster source of
// truth); the comms layer reads the same `Account` so a channel member id and an
// agent's account id are one id space. Re-exported so comms consumers keep
// importing `Account` from here (their comms seam) without reaching across.
