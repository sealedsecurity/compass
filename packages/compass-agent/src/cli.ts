// `compass-agent` — the in-container entrypoint the Runner execs.
//
// The Runner starts the agent with a bare `compass-agent` argv and no flags
// (`go/internal/runner/relay.go` `agentCommand`), so this process takes its
// entire configuration from the environment it is launched into:
//
//   - the Runner socket at a FIXED path — `/run/compass/agent.sock`, bind-mounted
//     per container (`internal/runner/host.go:33`), chosen "so the agent needs no
//     per-session configuration" (`host.go:28-29`);
//   - the model selector from `COMPASS_MODEL`;
//   - the block-0 role selector from `COMPASS_ROLE`, naming a
//     `prompts/<role>/SYSTEM.md` in the mount that REPLACES the agent's default
//     block-0 (delivered as `customSystemPrompt`);
//   - the persona identity overlay from `COMPASS_PERSONA`, appended AFTER the
//     agent's default system prompt (or after the role block-0 when both set);
//   - the provider credential from the 0600 `$HOME/.compass/auth-seed.json` the
//     Runner's materializer writes (design §T5);
//   - the materialized tool/MCP secrets from the 0600 `$HOME/.compass/env` the
//     Runner's materializer writes as `KEY=VALUE` lines (SEA-1327 T5), sourced
//     into the process environment before the session is built.
//
// It composes three things and runs them: an `AgentSession` from
// `createAgentSession` (which loads extensions/MCP/skills/tools/the model
// registry/auth), the socket carrier
// (`createSocketFrameSink` / `createSocketControlSource`), and
// `CompassAgent` over both.
//
// Structure follows the repo's construction/execution split: every decision is a
// pure exported function tested in `cli.test.ts`, and `main()` is the thin
// composition that performs IO. `main` is itself tested there over the `MainDeps`
// seam — the two unfakeable constructors (session, socket carrier) are
// injectable, everything between them is the real thing.
